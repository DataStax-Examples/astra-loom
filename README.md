Loom is a thread based chat server, where users can send messages to one or more threads via hashtags (ex. "I'm heading to the park at noon #family #friends #frisbee_club" ).  Users can subscribe to new threads they see by clicking them and start new threads but just adding a new hashtag to a message.
  
## How this works
The app demonstrates working with DataStax Astra, Elixir, and Phoenix Liveviews together. The project attempts to make the best use of this stack.  Messages histories are saved and loaded in Astra, while new messages are shared via Phoenix channels between all active users in a "thread".  The goal is a fast, scalable, and durable chat/messaging application.

## Get Started

already have one:
